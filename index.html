        <h3 style="text-align:center;">Experience in HTML and CSS</h3>
        <p style="text-align:center;">When I was in high school,I had computer labs where they taught me basic level computer languages like C, SQL, HTML and CSS. </p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">Eventually, I was fascinated by how the interaction between a human and computer is.</p> 
        <p style="text-align:center;">With that enthusiasm I did my bachelors in computer science where I could learn in depth.</p>
        <p style="text-align:center;">I have created a few web pages which helped me get hands on experience in HTML and CSS.</p>
